      <p>This website's purpose is to serve as a website to take in user inputs for the program.</p>
      <p>The program's purpose is to gather data from City College of San Francisco's public website of Degrees and Certificates, then organize it. After that, the user enters a course number (i.e. CNIT 120) and the output will be a list of Certificates and Degrees that course qualifies for. Invalid inputs will return an ERROR message.</p>
            
      <form action="/action_page.php">
        <label for="course_name">Enter course name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="user_input" name="user_input" value=""><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
      </form>

  <!--
  TODO: "Submit" is the user input value and has to go somewhere
  TODO: Add Javascript to check if the user input is valid, make regex?
  	TODO: Check whether adding the Javascript is necessary for this task.
  TODO: Add a function where the database also saves the link and lets the user click it to go directly?
  TODO: Check in to see how often things should be scrapped.
  Sift out the defunct majors and certificates?
  Maybe add CSS to make everything look?
