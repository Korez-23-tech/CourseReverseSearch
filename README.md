# Course Reverse Search 💻
The program's purpose is to gather data from City College of San Francisco's public website of Degrees and Certificates, then organize it. After that, the user enters a course number (i.e. CNIT 120) and the output will be a list of Certificates and Degrees that course qualifies for. Invalid inputs will return an ERROR message.

This is neat!
